    Description:
          Hai Team,
              I found a IDOR on https://dorahacks.io website. It's leads to attacker can invite any members using any users organizations.
   
   Proof-Of-Concept:
     1. Create 2 accounts  (C,B C=attacker B=victim)
     2. A attacker can get the victim user-token via the cookie
     3. Now attacker can easily identify the victim organization id using burute fore method.
     4. A attacker can invite any members to the organizaton without the permission of the owner.

  Impact:
    1. IDOR
  
  POC:
    I am attached poc video on github folder
